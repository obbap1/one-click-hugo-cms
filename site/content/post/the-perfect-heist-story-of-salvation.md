title: The Perfect Heist; Story of Salvation

description: >-
  Welcome to the story of salvation, not an allusion, but an explicit attempt at
  connecting dots... I am no theology expert so pardon some pitfalls. This is a
  work of art for lovers of Art, Jesus and Money Heist. If you do not like any
  of the above, you could still read, since we all do not have so much to keep
  us busy. This work was inspired by Kurt Bruner & Jim Ware's "Finding God in
  the Land of Narnia". You could call it "Finding Salvation in Money Heist", but
  I personally wouldn't call it that. Let's get stealing...

## In the beginning, LOVE...

The heist story starts like every other story... a love story like no other, exotic trees, beach view and all the intimacy that sets true love on fire. Heists are never supposed to happen, they are usually reactionary and this was no different. It was Rio and Tokyo and the forbidden fruit was that phone call. The father had issued a commandment like the professor did, stick together and no phone calls... that seems simple enough to me, but Tokyo could not but experience the thrill, she bit and guess what, Adam loved her so much that he broke the rules as well. Let's talk a little about why Adam ate the fruit, in 1st Timothy 2:14, the scriptures says that Adam was not deceived, so the only reason he did that was because he loved his bride and would rather die with her than see her die alone. This is a serious point and the heist in fact would be patterned after this particular part of history as well as another when Jesus sees his bride fallen and has to die for her... Adam broke the social distancing rule that was laid down and this was when the Interpol and Prieto latched unto them and at this point, the heist was conceived to rescue the fallen man Rio...

Many may be uncomfortable with alluding the finished work of Christ to robbery, but Luke 11:21 -22 says exactly that paraphrasing "_... when the strong Royal Mint of Spain keeps it goods, all is fine and good until a stronger then he comes, he takes everything he trusts in and then launches an air balloon in the middle of Madrid to share the spoil."_

Let's circle back a bit  (common words during this Corona working from Home thing !) to when the heist was conceived; in Genesis 3:15, the professor's father had an active plan to bruise the head of Prieto, but also give the heel of his son to be bruised (knowing that Prieto would be drawn to this).  This was the ultimate heist and many lives could be lost but the only variation in which this plan does not fail is the word becoming flesh and dwelling among men; imagine the professor had to go in to save a heist !! Must be wild in there and that's exactly what Jesus did. Just like Lisbon, He dove right into the middle of this and it's one that never ends, because it continues into the great commission and we must put on our coveralls and masks like Paul the apostle in 1st Corinthians 9:19-23.

In the infinite wisdom of the father, wasn't there another way to perfect this robbery ? I've asked myself, why send your only begotten son to the slaughter ? ... Remember Abraham ? I do not have any fictional representation for him but let's talk a bit about him; Like the father, he was also without a son for a very long time. Don't get me wrong, Jesus had always been with God and from God but not as a son, He was the word, the express image of the father, but never the son, in that manner, Abraham was an archetype of the father. He was put through a test after he had Isaac and was going to sacrifice his own son, but God stayed his hand in Genesis 22:10, and like the most demanding TikTok challenge ever created, God took his own son up that hill and as Dr. Ravi Zacharias says, that hand did not stop, it came all the way down and the father sacrificed his own son for the sins of the world. The professor had to lose his life to save the plan.

## Emotional Flares & Scares

Even for the those keeping people hostage, heists are never pleasant especially when there are codes of conducts. As the professor, so the scripture says in 2nd Peter 3:9, that it is not the father's will that any should perish  (during this continued heist) but that all should come to repentance. We all witnessed the many times Tokyo, Nairobi, Rio, Denver insulted and blamed the professor for being so calm because he was on the outside and couldn't understand what they were going through, but not our own captain. As the scripture says in Hebrews 4:15 "...we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weakness, because ... he went through it all." This OG went all the way in, took the pain and before the apex of the plan, he broke down and didn't want to continue, in Luke 22:42, he even asked if this cup could be taken away, but even in that moment of weakness, he recognized the living will of the father above his. He had all right to call down fire on Arturo Roman when he came mocking at him and teasing him, but he did not let the emotional flares get through to him...



## PLAN HADES

"This is why the heist will succeed", (we know how the professor had always planned every move and always had fancy names for each stage of the operation) (... for had they known, they would not  have crucified the Lord of glory) this is from 1st Corinthians 2:6-8. The whole plan was predicated on Jesus dying on the cross like the prophets has prophesied. If Christ did not die, then he would not even rise, if he did not rise, then out faith is in vain (1 Corinthians 15:14). Like the Professor had to go meet Raquel at that bar, Jesus had to embrace the grave and go into Hades to ensure victory for the saints locked in the Royal Mint who were depending on his victory and Resurrection. Prieto was more cunning than any beast the EU could produce and he believed that once the professor was dead, so was the plan, but not when the grave was the father's trump card. This son would die like seeds die to soils, then bloom on the 3rd day. The father was like the Queen of Katwe seeing several variations ahead. This was why the heist succeeded and this is why we trust the wisdom of God always.

A son was born to a virgin, lived and died on the cross, resurrected on the third day, hence rebuilding the temple for total access to the father like he said he would, and finally handing over the keys of hell and of death. This is the story of the Cross. This is the story of Salvation. This is the story of the greatest heist that would ever be told.
